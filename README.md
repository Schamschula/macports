# macports
This is a local branch of MacPorts Portfiles and patches. Some represent commits, submitted tickets, while others are works in progress, and some won't ever be merged into the main macports/macports-ports repository.

See https://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories for details how to configure a local repository.
