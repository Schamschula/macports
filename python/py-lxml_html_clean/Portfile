description         HTML cleaner is blocklist-based. 
long_description    {*}${description} This project was initially a part of lxml, but \
                    many reports about possible security vulnerabilities were filed \
                    for lxml and that make the project problematic for \
                    security-sensitive environments. Therefore we decided to extract \
                    the problematic part to a separate project.
