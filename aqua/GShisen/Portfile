description         The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the field.
long_description    ${description} Only two matching tiles can be removed at a time. \
                    Two tiles can only be removed if they can be connected with at most \
                    three connected lines. Lines can be horizontal or vertical but not \
                    diagonal.
