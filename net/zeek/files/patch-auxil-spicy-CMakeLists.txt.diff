+# Spicy builds its unit tests as part of `ALL`. They are usually not only
+# uninteresting for us but might cause problems. Since any configuration
+# we do for our unit tests happens through global C++ compiler flags, they
+# would get inherited directly by Spicy which can cause issues, e.g., we set
+# `-DDOCTEST_CONFIG_DISABLE` if `ENABLE_ZEEK_UNIT_TESTS` is false, but Spicy
+# unit test do not anticipate this define being set.
